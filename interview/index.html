		<h3>How did you become interested in graphic design?</h3>
		<p> I've always been interested and appreciated art. I discovered the world of graphic design on Instagram, and I loved the idea of mixing art and functionality together. </p>

		<h3>Where do you look for inspiration for your designs?</h3>
		<p> The main place I look for inspiration is Instagram. I follow many dedicated graphic design accounts that gives tips and share interesting work, I also follow individual designers whose work I'm interested in.</p>

		<h3>What is your favourite software to use?</h3>
		<p> My favorite software to use is probably Photoshop, though most of the time I’ll use it in tandem with Illustrator I love adding texture to my designs, and for that Photoshop is king.</p>

		<h3>Why is it important to learn about the history of design?</h3>
		<p>It's important to learn about the history of design, where it came from and where it is now. Also to study the notable designers of history to get Inspiration from.</p>

		<h3>Which area of graphic design are you most interested in?</h3>
		<p>I'm still not sure if I’ve found my niche in the graphic design world yet because I find so many different areas of graphic design interesting such as web design, logo design, photo manipulation, poster design, etc.</p>

		<h3>Would you prefer to freelance or work for a company?</h3>
		<p>I’d love to work freelance, ideally. But that's a hard feat to accomplish right off the bat. So I’d be more than happy to work for a company till I build my own clientele and have the ability to go freelance.</p>

		<h3>Prior to this program, what kind of graphic design experience do you have?</h3>
		<p> Prior to this program I have no credible experience, but I was interested in it for a while. Coming into this program I have a decent understanding of Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

		<h3>What time of the day do you prefer to work on your designs?</h3>
		<p>I am not a morning person.... I think that answers itself.</p>

		<h3>What makes a successful website?</h3>
		<p>The most important thing to me that makes a well-designed website, is simplicity and clarity. Functionality should come before the art of it.</p>
